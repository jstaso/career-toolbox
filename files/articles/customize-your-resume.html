<h1>How To Customize Your Resume</h1>

<p>You&rsquo;ve spent days crafting the perfect resume. But employers aren&rsquo;t calling you for an interview.
    There could be a number of reasons for this, but one of the most common is failing to customize your resume to
    the specific job opening. In the modern job search, your resume needs to be tweaked and customized
    <strong> every time </strong> you apply for a different position.&nbsp; This is critical if you want your
    resume to catch the attention of applicant tracking systems and hiring managers and recruiters!</p>

<h2>Types of Qualifications</h2>

<p>There are at least six different types of qualifications you should be considering when you read a job ad or
    position description. In order to tailor your resume for each specific role, read through the job description
    with a <strong>highlighter</strong> looking for specific keywords that describe what the employer is looking
    for.</p>

<p>Better yet, copy and paste the description into a word doc and <strong>highlight</strong> the key words you will
    need in your resume.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Skills</strong> &ndash; Competencies, Procedures, Tools</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge</strong> &ndash; Expertise, Terminology, Language</li>
    <li><strong>Attitudes</strong> &ndash; Values, Passions, Enthusiasm, Interests</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Traits</strong> &ndash; Talents, Natural Abilities, Personality</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Education</strong> &ndash; Training, Certificates, Degrees</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Experience</strong> &ndash; Work History</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Master Resume</h2>
<p>Now, the easiest process to make this work, is to keep your <strong>Master resume</strong> on your
    <strong>desktop</strong>. Whenever you need to customize it, make a copy, then adjust the copy to match
    the job you are applying to.</p>

<p>Make sure you also <strong>customize the document file name</strong>. Include your name and the position
    name, exactly as it&rsquo;s listed in the description, on the file itself.&nbsp; You should also
    <strong>place the exact name of the position as it&rsquo;s listed in the description at the top of your
        resume</strong>, under your contact information and over your summary or profile.</p>

<p>This will help the H.R. director or hiring manager find you and remember you. You would be surprised how
    many resumes are simply named &ldquo;resume&rdquo;.&nbsp; If a company is working with hundreds of
    resumes, that doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<h2>Using Jobscan</h2>
<p>A great tool for seeing how your resume matches up is the website <strong>Jobscan</strong>. You can
    upload your resume and the job posting and get a detailed report of how you match up, and what you can
    do to make your resume stand out. It&rsquo;s free, all you need to do is create an account. If you find
    yourself having trouble getting interviews, this tool can make a big difference. Give it a try,
    you&rsquo;ll be amazed at the results.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jobscan.co/">https://www.jobscan.co/</a></p>

<h2>Sample Job Descriptions</h2>
<p>The following pages have sample job descriptions, where the <strong>keywords </strong>have been
    <strong>highlighted</strong>. Use these examples to understand which words are important for you to pay
    attention to, and to incorporate into your resume. The more keywords that match up to your abilities,
    the better your chances of getting an interview. It may seem like a lot of work, at first, but as you
    get better at deciphering a job posting, it soon becomes second nature. It&rsquo;s a competitive world
    out there, to get calls, you need to be doing all you can to get recognized. This is just one of the
    many tools you should be using to get noticed!</p>

<p>Not only should you be using these keywords in your resume, but you will also need to be aware of them in
    an interview. If you put a skill on a resume, be prepared to speak about them in an interview. If you
    are not confident in that ability, don&rsquo;t put it on the resume.</p>
